# TSP-Analysis

Travelling Salesman problem is one of the very famous problem in buisness and as well as in computer science domain
I explored different approaches to solve the TSP, including the nearest neighbour and greedy techniques, and implemented a genetic algorithm to find an optimised solution.
TSP problem can be reduced to psuedopolynomial time : Advanced Algorithms

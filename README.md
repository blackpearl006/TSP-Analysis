# TSP-Analysis

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem that belongs to the field of operations research and theoretical computer science. The problem can be summarized as follows: Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

Formally, the TSP can be defined as follows: Given a set of n cities and a distance matrix containing the distances between every pair of cities, the objective is to find a permutation of the cities that minimizes the total distance traveled while visiting each city exactly once and returning to the starting city.

The TSP is an NP-hard problem, which means that finding the optimal solution for large instances becomes increasingly difficult and time-consuming as the number of cities increases. Despite its seemingly simple definition, the TSP has profound implications in various fields such as logistics, transportation planning, manufacturing, and even genetics. Many real-world problems can be formulated as instances of the TSP, where the goal is to find the most efficient route to minimize costs or time.

Due to its computational complexity, various approximation algorithms, heuristics, and metaheuristics have been developed to find good solutions for the TSP in a reasonable amount of time. Some well-known techniques include the nearest neighbor algorithm, the minimum spanning tree algorithm, and genetic algorithms.

The Traveling Salesman Problem remains a classic problem in the study of optimization and computational complexity, continuing to capture the attention of researchers and inspiring the development of new algorithms and techniques to tackle its challenges.

I explored different approaches to solve the TSP, including the nearest neighbour and greedy techniques, and implemented a genetic algorithm to find an optimised solution.
